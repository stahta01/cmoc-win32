.sh SYNOPSIS
.bb
wait(status)
int *status;
.sp
wait(0)
.eb
.sh DESCRIPTION
.db
.bo
WAIT
is used to halt the current process until a child process has terminated.
.sp
.bo
WAIT
returns the process ID of the terminating process and places the status of
that process in the integer pointed to by
.ul
status
unless
.ul
status
is zero.  A
.bo
WAIT
must be executed for each child process spawned.
.sp
The status of the terminating child process will contain the argument of the
.ul
exit()
or
.ul
_exit()
call if the child process or the signal number if it was interrupted.  A
normally terminating C program with no call to
.ul
exit
or
.ul
_exit
has an implied call of
.ul
exit(0).
