.sh NAME
.bb
write, writeln - write to a file or device
.eb
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bb
write(pn, buffer, count)
char *buffer;
int pn, count;
.sp
writeln(pn, buffer, count)
char *buffer
int pn, count;
.eb
.sh DESCRIPTION
.db
.bo
WRITE
and
.bo
WRITELN
write to the path number
.ul
pn
which must be a value returned by
.ul
open(), create(), creat(),
or
.ul
dup(),
or should be 0 (stdin), 1 (stdout), or 2 (stderr).
.sp
.ul
Buffer
should point to an area of memory from which
.ul
count
bytes are to be written.  Write returns the actual number of bytes written
and if this is different from
.ul
count,
an error has occured.
.sp
Writes in multiples of 256 bytes to a file offset boundries of 256 bytes are
the most efficient.
.sp
.bo
WRITE causes no "line-editing" to occur on the output.
.bo
WRITELN
causes line-editing and only writes up to the first "\\n" (newline) in the
buffer if this is found before
.ul
count
is exhausted.  For a full description of the actions of these calls, the reader
is referred to the OS-9 documentation.
.ed
.sh DIAGNOSTICS
.db
A -1 is returned if
.ul
pn
is a bad path number, if
.ul
count
is ridiculous, or upon a physical I/O error.
