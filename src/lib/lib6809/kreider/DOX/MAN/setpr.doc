             SSEETTPPRR sets the process identified by _p_i_d (process ID) to 
             have a priority of _p_r_i_o_r_i_t_y.  The lowest priority is 0 and 
             the highest is 255.  

             A currently running process cannot change the priority of 
             another running process if the two process' do not share 
             ownership.  In addition, a process, if not owned by the 
             super user, cannot upgrade its priority to a level higher 
             than the parent process that created it with the OS-9 
             system call.  However, a process owned by the super user, 
             or any system process, can change the priority of any other 
             running process to any level.

             A -1 will be returned if the process does not have the same 
             user ID as the calling process.
