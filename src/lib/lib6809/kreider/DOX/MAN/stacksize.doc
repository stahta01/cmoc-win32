             The stack area is the currently reserved memory for 
             exclusive use of the stack.  As each C function is entered, 
             a routine in the system interface is called to reserve 
             enough stack space for the use of the function with an 
             additional 64 bytes.  The 64 bytes are for the use of 
             user-written assembly language code functions and/or the 
             system interface and/or arithmetic routines.  A record is 
             kept of the lowest address so far granted for the stack.  
             If the area requested would not bring this lower, then the 
             C function allowed to proceed.  If the new lower limit 
             would mean that the stack area would overlap the data area, 
             then the program stops with the message 

                  ****  STACK OVERFLOW  ****

             on the standard error outpath.  Otherwise, the new lower 
             limit is set, and the C function resumes as before.  

             If the stack check code is in effect, then a call to 
             SSTTAACCKKSSIIZZEE will return the maximum number of bytes of stack 
             used at the time of the call.  This call can be used to 
             determine the stack size required by the program.  

             FFRREEEEMMEEMM will return the number of bytes of the stack that 
             has not been used.

             Of course, all this depends on if the program was compiled 
             with stack checking enabled.  If stack checking was 
             disabled (cc -s code.c), then no stack checking occurs.
