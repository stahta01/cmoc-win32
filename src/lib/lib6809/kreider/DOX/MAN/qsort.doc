             The QQSSOORRTT subroutine is an implementation of the quick-sort 
             algorithm.  The first argument is a pointer to the base of 
             the data; the second is the number of elements; the third 
             is the size of an element in bytes; the last is the name of 
             the comparison routine to be called with two arguments 
             which are pointers to the elements being compared.  The 
             _c_o_m_p_a_r() routine must return an integer less than, equal 
             to, or greater than 0 according as the first argument is to 
             be considered less than, equal to, or greater than the 
             second.
