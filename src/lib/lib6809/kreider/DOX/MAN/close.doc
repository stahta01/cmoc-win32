             CCLLOOSSEE closes an already opened file as described by the 
             path number _p_n, which is the path number returned from an 
             _o_p_e_n(), _c_r_e_a_t(), _c_r_e_a_t_e() or _d_u_p() call.  

             Termination of a process always closes all opened files 
             automatically, but it is necessary to close files where 
             multiple files are opened by the process and it is desired 
             to re-use the path numbers to avoid exceeding the process 
             or system path number limit.
