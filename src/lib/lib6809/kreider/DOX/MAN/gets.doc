             The GGEETTSS routine reads a string into _s from the standard 
             input path _s_t_d_i_n .  The string is terminated by a newline 
             character, which is replaced in _s by a null character.  The 
             GGEETTSS routine returns its argument.  

             FFGGEETTSS routine reads _n-_1 characters, or up to a newline 
             character, whichever comes first, from the file pointed to 
             by _f_p into the string _s.  The last character read into _s is 
             followed by a null character.  FFGGEETTSS routine returns its 
             first argument.

             The different treatment of the newline ("\n") character by 
             these functions is retained here for portability reasons.

             Both functions return _n_u_l_l on end-of-file or if an error 
             occurs.
