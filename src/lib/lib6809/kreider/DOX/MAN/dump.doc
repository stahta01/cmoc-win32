             void _dump(s, addr, count)
             int count;
             char *s, *addr;

             DDUUMMPP is used mostly as a debugging function.  It prints the 
             title _s and then, starting at the memory address pointed to 
             by _a_d_d_r, dumps at the most _c_o_u_n_t bytes to standard output.

             Care must be taken to insure the variable _c_o_u_n_t is not too 
             large, else the memory dump will take a very long time.  
             Also, the dump is formatted similar to the standard OS9 
             dump utility.
