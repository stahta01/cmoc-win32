             The FFEERRRROORR function returns nonzero when an error has 
             occurred reading or writing the file associated with the 
             file pointer _f_p has reached its end, otherwise zero is 
             returned.  Unless cleared by CCLLEEAARREERRRR, the error indication 
             lasts until the file pointed to by _f_p is closed, thus 
             preventing any further access to that file.  

             The FFEEOOFF function returns nonzero when end of file is read 
             on the named input _f_p, otherwise zero.  

             The CCLLEEAARREERRRR function resets both the error and _E_O_F 
             indicators on the named file associated with _f_p.  Note that 
             the file is not "fixed" nor does it prevent the error from 
             occurring again.  It just allows Standard Library functions 
             to at least try to access the file.  

             The FFIILLEENNOO function returns the integer path descriptor 
             associated with the file pointer _f_p, for use with Standard 
             Library calls the use path numbers, such as _c_l_o_s_e(), 
             _o_p_e_n(), etc.

             These functions are implemented as macros in SSTTDDIIOO.HH so 
             they cannot be redeclared.
