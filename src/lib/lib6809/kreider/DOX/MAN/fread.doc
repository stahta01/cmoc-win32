             fread, fwrite - read/write binary data

             fread(ptr, sizeof(item), nitems, fp)

             The ffrreeaadd function reads into a buffer beginning at _p_t_r, 
             _n_i_t_e_m_s of data of the type _i_t_e_m from the input file pointer 
             _f_p.  It returns the number of items actually read.  

             The ffwwrriittee function writes, at most, _n_i_t_e_m_s of data of the 
             type _i_t_e_m beginning at _p_t_r to the named output file _f_p.  It 
             returns the number of items actually written.  

             In both cases, the type _i_t_e_m refers to either a char, int, 
             or unsigned data type.  Care must be taken to insure the 
             correct values are used.  If, for example, 10 bytes of type 
             _c_h_a_r are to be written, then this is the same amount of 
             data going to the output stream as 5 bytes of type _i_n_t.

             Both functions return a _n_u_l_l at end of file or if an error 
             occurs.  To insure the correct data is read or written, the 
             returned number of type _i_t_e_m should be compared to what was 
             intended.  If there is a difference, an error has occured.
