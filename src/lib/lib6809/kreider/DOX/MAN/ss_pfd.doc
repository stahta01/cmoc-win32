             _ss_pfd -- set and write file descriptor

             int _ss_pfd(path, buffer)
             int path;

             SSSS_PPFFDD will copy certain bytes from the buffer pointed to 
             by _b_u_f_f_e_r into the file descriptor sector of the file 
             opened on _p_a_t_h.  The buffer is usually obtained from the 
             GGSS_GGFFDD function.  Only the owner ID, the modification date, 
             and the creation date is changed.  

             The structure _F_I_L_D_E_S declared in DDIIRREECCTT.HH provides a 
             convenient means to access the file descriptor 
             information.

             The buffer must be at least 16 bytes long or garbage could 
             be written into the file descriptor sector.  The owner ID 
             field can be changed only by the super-user.  It is 
             impossible to change the file attributes with the call.  
             Instead, use the SSSS_AATTTTRR function.
