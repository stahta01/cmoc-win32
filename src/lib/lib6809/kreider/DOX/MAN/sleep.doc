             The current process is stopped for the specified amount of 
             time.  If _s_e_c_o_n_d_s is zero, the process will sleep for one 
             time-slice (tick).  

             The actual suspension time may be different than that 
             requested if a wake-up signal is received before the sleep 
             timer ends.
