             These calls change the current data and execution 
             directories respectively.  This change is only current as 
             long as the process is running.  _D_i_r_n_a_m_e is a pointer to 
             the directory pathlist string.

             Each call returns zero after a succesful call, or -1 if 
             _d_i_r_n_a_m_e is not a directory or its path is not searchable.
