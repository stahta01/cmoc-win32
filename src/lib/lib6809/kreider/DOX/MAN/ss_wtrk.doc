             SSSS_WWRRTTKK performs a write-track operation on a disk drive.  
             It is essentially a direct hook into the driver's 
             write-track entry point.  

             The argument _p_a_t_h is the path on which the device is 
             opened.  _T_r_k_n_o is the desired track number to write, and 
             _s_i_d_e_n is the desired side of the disk on which to write.  
             When the write is performed, the image contained in and 
             pointed to by _t_r_k_b_u_f is written out to the disk.  

             If an error occurs, _SSSS_WWTTRRKK returns the value -1 and the 
             error code is placed in the global variable _e_r_r_n_o.

             This function works only on RRBBFF devices.  Additional 
             information on how it works can be obtained from examining 
             the FFOORRMMAATT utility or a device driver.  Also, note there is 
             a difference in the syntax of this call from that used in 
             OSK systems.

             If the variable _t_r_k_n_o is set to zero when this function is 
             called, the EENNTTIIRREE disk, floppy or hard disk, will be 
             formatted.  Care should be taken to insure that _t_r_k_n_o has a 
             non-zero value prior to entering this function.
