             PPAATTMMAATTCCHH searches the string _s for the pattern in _p_a_t and 
             returns true is there is a match.  The pattern _p_a_t must 
             contain wildcard characters of '*' and '?', where '*' 
             denotes a string of characters of any type and length, and 
             '?' denotes a single character of any type.  Expansion of 
             wildcards is performed within the function.  

             If no match is found, false is returned.  

             If _f_l_a_g is set as true, PPAATTMMAATTCCHH will ignore the case of 
             both strings buy calling the function _t_o_u_p_p_e_r() to make 
             both the pattern and the string all uppercase characters 
             prior to matching.  Otherwise, an exact match is required.
