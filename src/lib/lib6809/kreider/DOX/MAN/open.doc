             open - open a file for read/write access

             OOPPEENN opens an already existing file for reading if _m_o_d_e is 
             1, for writing if _m_o_d_e is 2, or reading and writing if _m_o_d_e 
             is 3.  NNOOTTEE that these values are OS-9 specific and are not 
             compatible with other systems.  _F_n_a_m_e should point to a 
             string representing the pathname of the file to be opened.  

             OOPPEENN returns an integer as the "path number" which should 
             be used by I/O system calls referring to the file.  

             The position where reads or writes start is at the 
             beginning of the file.

             A -1 is returned if the file does not exist, if the 
             pathname cannot be searched, if too many files are already 
             open, or if the file permissions deny the requested mode.
