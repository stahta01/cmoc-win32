             SSSS_LLOOCCKK locks out a section of a file open on _p_a_t_h from the 
             current file position up to the number of bytes specified 
             by _l_o_c_k_s_i_z_e.  

             If the locksize is zero, all locks (record lock, EOF lock, 
             and file lock) are removed.  If a locksize of 0xFFFFFFFF is 
             requested, the entire file is locked regardless of where in 
             the file the file pointer is.  This is a special type of 
             file lock that remains in effect until released by 
             __s_s__l_o_c_k(_p_a_t_h,_0), a read or write of zero or more bytes, or 
             the file is closed.  

             If an error occurs, the function returns the value -1 and 
             the error code is placed in the global variable _e_r_r_n_o.
