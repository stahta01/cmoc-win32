             WWAAIITT is used to halt the current process until a child 
             process has terminated.  

             WWAAIITT returns the process ID of the terminating process and 
             places the status of that process in the integer pointed to 
             by _s_t_a_t_u_s unless _s_t_a_t_u_s is zero.  A WWAAIITT must be executed 
             for each child process spawned.  

             The status of the terminating child process will contain 
             the argument of the _e_x_i_t() or __e_x_i_t() call if the child 
             process or the signal number if it was interrupted.  A 
             normally terminating C program with no call to _e_x_i_t or 
             __e_x_i_t has an implied call of _e_x_i_t(_0).

             compatible with codes from other operating systems.

             A -1 is returned if there is no child to be waited for.
