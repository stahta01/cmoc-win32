             access - give file accessibility

             #include <modes.h>

             access(fname, perm)
             char *fname;
             int perm;

             AACCCCEESSSS returns zero if the access modes specified in _p_e_r_m 
             are correct for the user to access _f_n_a_m_e.  A -1 is returned 
             if the file cannot be accessed.  

             The value for _p_e_r_m may be any legal OS-9 mode as used for 
             _o_p_e_n() or _c_r_e_a_t(), or, it may be zero which then tests 
             whether or not the file exists or the path to it may be 
             searched.  

             AACCCCEESSSS is useful to test the existance of a file without 
             actually opening the file as would _o_p_e_n() or _f_o_p_e_n(), 
             thereby changing the user permissions.

             The values for _p_e_r_m are NOT compatible with other non-OS-9 
             systems.

             The returned error number, if a value of -1 is returned 
             from this call, will be found in the global variable _e_r_r_n_o, 
             and will indicate the reason that file cannot be accessed.
