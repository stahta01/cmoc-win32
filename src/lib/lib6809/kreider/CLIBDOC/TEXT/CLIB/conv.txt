.sh DESCRIPTION
.db
The functions
.bo
TOUPPER
and
.bo
TOLOWER
have as domain the range of
.ul
getc(),
which are the ASCII characters from -1 through 255.
If the argument to
.bo
TOUPPER
represents a lower case letter,
the result is the corresponding upper case letter.
If the argument to
.bo
TOLOWER
represents an upper case letter, the result is the corresponding lower case letter.
.PP
The macros
.bo
_TOUPPER
and
.bo
_TOLOWER
accomplish the same thing as
.bo
TOUPPER
and
.bo
TOLOWER ,
except they are faster and are restricted to ASCII characters (for example, -1
to 127).  The macro
.bo
_TOUPPER
requires a lowercase letter as its argument;
its result is the corresponding uppercase letter.
The macro
.bo
_TOLOWER
requires an uppercase letter as its argument;
its result is the corresponding lowercase letter.
.PP
The macro
.bo
TOASCII
yields its argument with all bits turned off that are not
part of a standard ASCII character set, i.e., the MSB of that character
is set to 0. It is intended for compatibility with other systems.
.ed

.db
Any arguments to the macros
.bo
_TOUPPER, _TOLOWER,
or
.bo
TOASCII
outside the ranges specified will yield garbage results.
