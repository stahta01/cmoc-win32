.sh NAME
.bb
_ss_opt - set file descriptor options
.eb
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bb
#include <sgstat.h>

int _ss_opt(path, buffer)
int path;
struct sgbuf *buffer;
.eb
.sh DESCRIPTION
.db
.bo
SS_OPT
copies the buffer pointed to be
.ul
buffer
into the options section of the path descriptor opened on
.ul
path.
.sp
Generally, a program will fetch the options with the
.bo
GS_OPT
function, change
the desired values, and then update the path options with the
.bo
SS_OPT
function. The structure
.ul
sgbuf
declared in
.bo
SGSTAT.H
provides a convenient
means to access the individual option values.
.sp
If the path is invalid, _ss_opt returns -1 and the appropriate error code is
placed in
.ul
errno.
.ed
.sh NOTE
.db
It is a common practice to preserve a copy of the original path descriptor
options so a program can restore them prior to exiting. The option changes
take effect on the currently open path and any path created with the I$DUP
system call.
