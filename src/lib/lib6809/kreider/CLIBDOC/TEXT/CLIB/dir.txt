.sh DESCRIPTION
.db
.bo
OPENDIR
opens the specified directory and associates a directory stream with it.
.bo
OPENDIR
returns a pointer to be used to identify the directory stream in
subsequent operations. The pointer
.ul
null
is returned if
.ul
dirname
can not be accessed or of it can not "malloc" enough memory to hold the whole
thing. Directory sectors are NOT buffered.
.PP
.bo
READDIR
returns a pointer to a structure containing the next directory entry, unless
the entry is a deleted file in which case the next entry is returned.
It returns
.ul
null
upon reaching the end of the directory or detecting an invalid
.bo
SEEKDIR
operation.
.PP
.bo
TELLDIR
returns the current location associated with the named directory stream.
Values returned by
.bo
TELLDIR
are
valid only for the lifetime of the associated dir pointer. If the directory
is closed and then reopened, the
.bo
TELLDIR
value may be invalidated. It is safe to use a previous
.bo
TELLDIR
value immediately after a call to
.bo
OPENDIR
and before any calls to
.bo
READDIR.
.PP
.bo
REWINDDIR
resets the position of the named directory stream to the beginning of the
directory.
.PP
This function is implemented as a macro in
.bo
DIR.H.
.PP
.bo
SEEKDIR
sets the position of the next
.bo
READDIR
operation in the directory
stream. The new position reverts to the one associated with the directory
stream when the
.bo
TELLDIR
operation was performed.
.bo
CLOSEDIR
closes the named directory stream and frees the structure
associated with
.ul
dirp.
