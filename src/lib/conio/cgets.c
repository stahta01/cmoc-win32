/*
cgets reads a string of characters from the console, storing the string (and the string length)
in the location pointed to by str. cgets reads characters until it encounters a carriage-return/linefeed
(CR/LF) combination, or until the maximum allowable number of characters have been read.
If cgets reads a CR/LF combination, it replaces the combination with a \0 (null terminator)
before storing the string. Before cgets is called, set str[0] to the maximum length of the string
to be read. On return, str[1] is set to the number of characters actually read. The characters
read start at str[2] and end with a null terminator. Thus, str must be at least str[0] plus 2 bytes long.
