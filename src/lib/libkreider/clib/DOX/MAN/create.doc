             CCRREEAATTEE creates and opens the file named _f_n_a_m_e.  This call 
             accepts the file mode and access permissions in the same 
             function and is useful in setting up user permissions as 
             soon as the file is opened.  

             This function returns -1 if the file already exists.  

             OOCCRREEAATT performs the same function, except it deletes the 
             old file if it already exists when OOCCRREEAATTEE is called.
