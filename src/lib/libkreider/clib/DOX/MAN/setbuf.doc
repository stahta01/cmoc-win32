             setbuf - fix file buffer

             setbuf (fp, buffer)
             FILE *fp;
             char buffer;

             When the first character is written to or read from a file 
             after it has been opened by FFOOPPEENN(), a buffer is obtained 
             from the system, if required, and assigned to the file 
             pointer _f_p.  SSEETTBBUUFF may be used to forestall this automatic 
             buffer assignment by assigning a user buffer to the file.  

             SSEETTBBUUFF must be used after the file has been opened and 
             before any I/O has taken place.  

             The buffer must be of sufficient size and a value for a 
             manifest constant, BBUUFFSSIIZZ, is defined in the header file 
             for use in declaration.  

             If the _b_u_f_f_e_r argument is _N_U_L_L (0), the file stream becomes 
             unbuffered and characters are read or written singly.  

             NOTE that the standard error output defaults to unbuffered 
             while the standard output default to buffered output.
