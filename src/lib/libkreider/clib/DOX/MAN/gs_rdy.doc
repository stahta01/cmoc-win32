             This function checks an SSCCFF device opened on _p_a_t_h to see if 
             data is waiting to be read.  Read requests to OS9 will wait 
             until enough bytes have been read to satisfy the bytecount 
             given, thereby suspending the program until the read is 
             finished.  

             A program can use this function to determine the number of 
             bytes, if any, are waiting to be read, and then issue a 
             read request for only the number of bytes actually 
             received.  

             If _p_a_t_h is invalid, no data is available to be read, or the 
             device is not an SSCCFF device, a -1 is returned and the 
             appropriate error code is placed in _e_r_r_n_o.  Otherwise, the 
             number of bytes available to be read is returned.

             This call is effective only on _S_C_F devices.  This function 
             is not intended for use with buffered I/O calls (like 
             getc()), and unpredictable results will likely occur.  This 
             call works best with low-level I/O functions.
