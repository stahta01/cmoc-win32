             SSSS_SSSSIIGG sets up a signal to be sent to the calling process 
             when an interactive device has data ready.  When data is 
             received on the device indicates by _p_a_t_h, the signal 
             _s_i_g_c_o_d_e is sent to the calling process.  

             SSSS_SSSSIIGG must be called each time the signal is sent if it 
             is to be used again.  

             The device is considered busy, and will return an error, if 
             any read request arrives before the signal is sent.  Write 
             requests are allowed to the device while in this state.  

             If an error occurs, the function returns the value -1 and 
             the error code is placed in the global variable _e_r_r_n_o.
