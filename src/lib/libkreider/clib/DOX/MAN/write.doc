             WWRRIITTEE and WWRRIITTEELLNN write to the path number _p_n which must be 
             a value returned by _o_p_e_n(), _c_r_e_a_t_e(), _c_r_e_a_t(), or _d_u_p(), or 
             should be 0 (stdin), 1 (stdout), or 2 (stderr).  

             _B_u_f_f_e_r should point to an area of memory from which _c_o_u_n_t 
             bytes are to be written.  Write returns the actual number 
             of bytes written and if this is different from _c_o_u_n_t, an 
             error has occured.  

             Writes in multiples of 256 bytes to a file offset boundries 
             of 256 bytes are the most efficient.

             WWRRIITTEELLNN causes line-editing and only writes up to the first 
             "\n" (newline) in the buffer if this is found before _c_o_u_n_t 
             is exhausted.  For a full description of the actions of 
             these calls, the reader is referred to the OS-9 
             documentation.

             A -1 is returned if _p_n is a bad path number, if _c_o_u_n_t is 
             ridiculous, or upon a physical I/O error.
