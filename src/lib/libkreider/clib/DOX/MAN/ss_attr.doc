             SSSS_AATTTTRR changes a disk file's attributes.  The current 
             attributes of a file can be determined with the _GGSS_GGFFDD 
             function.  The attributes of a file can be changed only by 
             the owner of the file or the super user.  

             The attributes as selected in the word _a_t_t_r are set in the 
             file opened on _p_a_t_h.  The header file MMOODDEESS.HH defines the 
             valid mode values used in _a_t_t_r.  

             If an error occurs, the function returns the value -1 and 
             the error code is placed in the global variable _e_r_r_n_o.

             This function is effective even if the owner or super user 
             does not have write permission to the file.  It is not 
             permitted to set the directory bit of a non-directory file, 
             or to clear the directory bit of a directory that is not 
             empty.
