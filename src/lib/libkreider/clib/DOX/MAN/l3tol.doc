             l3tol, ltol3 - convert between 3-byte integers and long integers

             The LL33TTOOLL subroutine converts a list of _n three-byte 
             integers packed into a character string pointed to by _c_p 
             into a list of long integers pointed to by _l_p .  

             The LLTTOOLL33 performs the reverse conversion from long 
             integers _l_p to three-byte integers _c_p.  

             These functions are useful for file-system maintenance 
             where the block numbers are three bytes long.  Certain disc 
             addresses are maintained in three-byte form rather than 
             four-bytes.

             Because of possible differences in byte ordering, the 
             numerical values of the long integers are 
             machine-dependent.
