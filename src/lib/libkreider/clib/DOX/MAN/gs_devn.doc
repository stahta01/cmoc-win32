             This function determines the name of the device opened on a 
             path.  The argument _p_a_t_h is the OS-9 path number of the 
             opened path and _b_u_f_f_e_r is a pointer to a character array 
             into which the null-terminated device name will be placed.  

             The device name returned is in "OS9 format", that is, the 
             last byte of the name will have the high bit set.  Also, 
             there is no NULL terminator on the string.  The best method 
             to handle this returned value is: 

                          _gs_devn(path, buffer);
                          strhcpy(newbuff, buffer);

             If PATH is invalid, this function returns -1 as its value 
             and the error code is placed in the global variable ERRNO.

             Be sure to reserve at least 32 characters to receive the 
             device name.
