             lseek - seek to a position within a file

             long lseek(pn, position, type)
             int pn;
             long position;
             int type;

             The read or write pointer for the opened file with the path 
             number _p_n is positioned by LLSSEEEEKK to the specified place in 
             the file.  The _t_y_p_e indicates from where _p_o_s_i_t_i_o_n is to be 
             measured: if 0, from the beginning of the file, if 1, from 
             the current pointer location, and if 2, from the end of the 
             file.  

             Seeking to a location beyond the end of a file opened for 
             writing and then writing to it creates a "hole" in the file 
             which appears to be filled with zeros from the previous end 
             to the position desired.  

             The returned value is the resulting position in the file 
             unless there is an error, so to find the current position 
             use: 

                  lseek (pn, 0l, 1);

             The argument _p_o_s_i_t_i_o_n MUST be a long integer.  Constants 
             should be explicitly made long by appending an "l" (el - 
             lower case L), as above, any other type should be converted 
             using a cast: 

                  lseek (pn, (long)pos, 1);

             Notice also that the returned value from LLSSEEEEKK is itself a 
             long integer.

             A -1 is returned if _p_n is a bad path number, or attempting 
             to seek to a position before the beginning of the file.
