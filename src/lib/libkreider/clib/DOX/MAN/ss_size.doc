             SSSS_SSIIZZEE is used to change the size of a file opened on 
             _p_a_t_h.  The size change is immediate.  

             If the size of the file is decreased, the freed sectors are 
             returned to the system.  If the size is increased, sectors 
             are added to the file with the contents of those sectors 
             being undefined.  

             If an error occurs, _ss_size returns the value -1 and the 
             error code is placed in the global variable _e_r_r_n_o.
