             The FFSSEEEEKK function sets the position of the next input or 
             output operation on the already opened file pointed to by 
             _f_p.  The new position is at _o_f_f_s_e_t bytes from the 
             beginning, the current position, or the beginning of the 
             file if _p_l_a_c_e has the value 0, the current position if 1, 
             or the end of the file if 2.  

             The FFSSEEEEKK function undoes any effects of _u_n_g_e_t_c() and sorts 
             out the problems associated with buffered I/O.  

             NNOOTTEE: Using _l_s_e_e_k() on a buffered file will produce 
             unpredictable results.  

             The FFTTEELLLL function returns the current value of the offset 
             relative to the beginning of the file associated with the 
             file pointer _f_p.  It is measured in bytes and is the only 
             foolproof way to obtain an _o_f_f_s_e_t for FFSSEEEEKK.  

             The RREEWWIINNDD function is equivalent to _f_s_e_e_k(_f_p, _0_L, _0), 
             except that no value is returned.  It returns the file 
             pointer to the beginning of the file.

             FFSSEEEEKK returns a -1 if the call is invalid, otherwise it 
             returns zero.
