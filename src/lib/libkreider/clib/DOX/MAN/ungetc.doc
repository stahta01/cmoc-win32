             This function alters the state of the input file buffer 
             such that the next call of GGEETTCC returns the character _c_h.  

             Only one character may be puched back, and at least one 
             character must have been read from the file before a call 
             to UUNNGGEETTCC is made.  

             FFSSEEEEKK erases and characters pushed back.  

        DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS 

             UUNNGGEETTCC returns its character argument unless no pushback 
             could occur, in which case EOF is returned.
