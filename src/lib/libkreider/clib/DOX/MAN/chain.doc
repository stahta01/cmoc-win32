             chain - load and execute a new program module

             chain(modname, paramsize, paramptr, type, lang, datasize)
             char *modname, *paramptr;
             int paramsize, type, lang, datasize;

             The action of the FF$CCHHAAIINN system call is described fully in 
             the OS-9 documentation.  CCHHAAIINN implements this service 
             request as described there with one important exception: 
             chain will NEVER return to the caller.  If there is an 
             error, the chained process will abort and return to its 
             parent process.  It might be wise, therefore, for the 
             program to check the existance and access permissions of 
             the module before calling chain.  Permissions may be 
             checked by using _m_o_d_l_i_n_k() or _m_o_d_l_o_a_d() followed by 
             _m_u_n_l_i_n_k().  

             _M_o_d_n_a_m_e should point to the name of the desired module.  
             _P_a_r_a_m_s_i_z_e is the length of the parameter string (which 
             should be terminated with an '\n'), and _p_a_r_a_m_p_t_r points to 
             this parameter string.  _T_y_p_e is the module type as found in 
             the module header (normally a 1 for a program module), and 
             _l_a_n_g should match the language nibble in the module header 
             (C programs have a 1 for machine language).  _D_a_t_a_s_i_z_e my be 
             zero, or contain the number of 256 byte pages to give to 
             the new process as its initial data memory allocation.

             The variable _p_a_r_a_m_s_i_z_e should never be zero.  If only a 
             carriage return command line terminator (\n) is used, 
             _p_a_r_a_m_s_i_z_e should be set to one.
