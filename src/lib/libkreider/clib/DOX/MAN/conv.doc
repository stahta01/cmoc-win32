             The functions TTOOUUPPPPEERR and TTOOLLOOWWEERR have as domain the range 
             of _g_e_t_c(), which are the ASCII characters from -1 through 
             255.  If the argument to TTOOUUPPPPEERR represents a lower case 
             letter, the result is the corresponding upper case letter.  
             If the argument to TTOOLLOOWWEERR represents an upper case letter, 
             the result is the corresponding lower case letter.  

             The macros _TTOOUUPPPPEERR and _TTOOLLOOWWEERR accomplish the same thing 
             as TTOOUUPPPPEERR and TTOOLLOOWWEERR , except they are faster and are 
             restricted to ASCII characters (for example, -1 to 127). 
             The macro _TTOOUUPPPPEERR requires a lowercase letter as its 
             argument; its result is the corresponding uppercase 
             letter.  The macro _TTOOLLOOWWEERR requires an uppercase letter as 
             its argument; its result is the corresponding lowercase 
             letter.  

             The macro TTOOAASSCCIIII yields its argument with all bits turned 
             off that are not part of a standard ASCII character set, 
             i.e., the MSB of that character is set to 0. It is intended 
             for compatibility with other systems.

             Any arguments to the macros _TTOOUUPPPPEERR, _TTOOLLOOWWEERR, or TTOOAASSCCIIII 
             outside the ranges specified will yield garbage results.
