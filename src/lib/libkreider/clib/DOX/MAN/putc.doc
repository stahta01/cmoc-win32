             putc, putchar, putw - put character or word on a stream

             The PPUUTTCC routine appends the character _c to the named 
             output _f_p.  It returns the character written.  

             The PPUUTTCCHHAARR(cc) routine is defined as a macro in the header 
             file SSTTDDIIOO.HH and is the same as _p_u_t_c (c, stdout).  

             The PPUUTTWW routine appends word (that is, a two byte word, 
             such as int), _w to the output _f_p.  It returns the word 
             written.  The PPUUTTWW routine neither assumes nor causes 
             special alignment in the file.  

             Output via PPUUTTCC is normally buffered except when buffering 
             is disabled with _s_e_t_b_u_f() or when the standard error output 
             path is used.  

        CCAAVVEEAATTSS 

             Because it is implemented as a macro, PPUUTTCCHHAARR treats its 
             argument with side effects incorrectly.  In particular, 
             `putchar(*c++);' doesn't work as expected.  

        DDIIAAGGNNOOSSTTIICCSS 

             PPUUTTCC and PPUUTTCCHHAARR return the character argument from a 
             successful call or EEOOFF upon error or end-of-file.  Since 
             EEOOFF is a good integer, _f_e_r_r_o_r() should be used to detect 
             PPUUTTWW errors.
