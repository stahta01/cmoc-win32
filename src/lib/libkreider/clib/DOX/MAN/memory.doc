             These functions operate as efficiently as possible on 
             memory areas (arrays of characters bounded by a count, not 
             terminated by a null character).  They do not check for the 
             overflow of any receiving memory area.  

             MMEEMMCCCCPPYY copies characters from memory area _S_2 into _s_1, 
             stopping after the first occurrence of character _c has been 
             copied, or after _n characters have been copied, whichever 
             comes first.  It returns a pointer to the character after 
             the copy of _c in _s_1, or a _n_u_l_l pointer if _c was not found 
             in the first _n characters of _s_2.  

             MMEEMMCCHHRR returns a pointer to the first occurrence of 
             character _c in the first _n characters of memory area _s, or 
             a _n_u_l_l pointer if _c does not occur.  

             MMEEMMCCMMPP compares its arguments, looking at the first _n 
             characters only, and returns an integer less than, equal 
             to, or greater than 0, according as _s_1 is lexicographically 
             less than, equal to, or greater than _s_2.  

             MMEEMMCCPPYY copies _n characters from memory area _s_2 to _s_1.  It 
             returns _s_1.  





                                                                




        MEMORY(3C)       Kreider OS-9 C Library       MEMORY(3C)


             MMEEMMSSEETT sets the first _n characters in memory area _s to the 
             value of character _c.  It returns _s_1.  

        NNOOTTEE 

             For user convenience, all these functions are declared in 
             the optional MMEEMMOORRYY.HH hheeaaddeerr ffiillee.  

        BBUUGGSS 

             MMEEMMCCMMPP uses native character comparison, which is unsigned 
             on some machines.  Thus, the sign of the value returned 
             when one of the characters has its high order bit set is 
             implementation-dependent.  

             Character movement is performed differently in different 
             implementations.  Thus, overlapping moves may yield 
             surprises.
