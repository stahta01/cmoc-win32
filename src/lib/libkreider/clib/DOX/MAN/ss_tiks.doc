             If a read or write request is made for a part of a file 
             that is locked out by another user, RRBBFF normally sleeps 
             indefinitely until the conflict is removed.  SSSS_TTIIKKSS may be 
             used to cause an error (E$Lock) to be returned to the 
             process if the conflict still exists after a specific 
             number of clock ticks have elapsed.  

             The argument _t_i_c_k_c_n_t specifies the number of ticks to wait 
             if the record-lock conflict occurs with the file open on 
             _p_a_t_h.  A tick count of zero (the default on RRBBFF devices), 
             causes a sleep until the record is released.  A tick count 
             of one means if the record is not released immediately, an 
             error is to be returned.  

             If an error occurs, _SSSS_TTIIKKSS returns the value -1 and the 
             error code is placed in the global variable _e_r_r_n_o.
