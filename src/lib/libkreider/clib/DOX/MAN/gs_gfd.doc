             _gs_gfd - get file descriptor

        SSYYNNOOPPSSIISS 

             #include <direct.h>

             int _gs_gfd(path, buffer, count)
             int path;
             struct fildes *buffer;
             int count;

             This function will place a copy of the RRBBFF file descriptor 
             sector of the file opened on PATH into the buffer pointed 
             to by _b_u_f_f_e_r.  A maximum of _c_o_u_n_t bytes are copied.  The 
             structure FFIILLDDEESS, declared in DDIIRREECCTT.HH, provides a 
             convenient method to access the file descriptor 
             information.  

             If and error occurs, this function returns -1 as its value 
             and the error code is placed in the global variable _e_r_r_n_o.  

        NNOOTTEE 

             Be sure the buffer is large enough to hold all the options, 
             or at least _c_o_u_n_t bytes.  This call is effective only on 
             RRBBFF devices.  Declaring the buffer as type "struct fildes" 
             is perfectly safe as this structure is predefined to be 
             large enough to hold all the file descriptor information.
