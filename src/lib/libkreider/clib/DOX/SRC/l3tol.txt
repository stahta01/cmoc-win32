.sh NAME
.bb
l3tol, ltol3 - convert between 3-byte integers and long integers
.eb
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bb
void l3tol (lp, cp, n)
long *lp;
char *cp;
int n;
.sp
void ltol3 (cp, lp, n)
char *cp;

.sh DESCRIPTION
.db
The
.bo
L3TOL
subroutine converts a list of
.ul
n
three-byte integers packed into a character string
pointed to by 
.ul
cp
into a list of long integers pointed to by
.ul
lp .
.PP
The
.bo
LTOL3
performs the reverse conversion from long integers
.ul
lp
to three-byte integers
.ul
cp.
.PP
These functions are useful for file-system maintenance
where the block numbers are three bytes long.  Certain disc addresses are
maintained in three-byte form rather than four-bytes.
.ed
.sh CAVEATS
.db
Because of possible differences in byte ordering,
the numerical values of the long integers are machine-dependent.
