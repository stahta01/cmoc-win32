.sh SYNOPSIS
.bb
#include <stdio.h>

char putc(c, fp)
char c;
FILE *fp;
.sp
char putchar(c)

.sh DESCRIPTION
.db
The
.bo
PUTC
routine appends the character
.ul
c
to the named output
.ul
fp.
It returns the character written.
.PP
The
.bo
PUTCHAR(c)
routine is defined as a macro in the header file
.bo
STDIO.H
and is the same as
.ul
putc
(c, stdout).
.PP
The
.bo
PUTW
routine appends word (that is, a two byte word, such as int),
.ul
w
to the output
.ul
fp.
It returns the word written.
The
.bo
PUTW
routine neither assumes nor causes special alignment in the file.
.PP
Output via
.bo
PUTC
is normally buffered except when buffering is disabled with
.ul
setbuf()
or when the standard error output path is used.
.ed
.sh CAVEATS
.db
Because it is implemented as a macro,
.bo
PUTCHAR
treats its
argument with side effects incorrectly.
In particular, `putchar(*c++);' doesn't work as expected.
.ed
.sh DIAGNOSTICS
.db
.bo
PUTC
and
.bo
PUTCHAR
return the character argument from a successful call or
.bo
EOF
upon error or end-of-file.
Since
.bo
EOF
is a good integer,
.ul
ferror()
should be used to detect 
.bo
PUTW
errors.
