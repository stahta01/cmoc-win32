_ss_tiks - set timeout tick count
.eb
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bb
int _ss_tiks(path, tickcnt)
int path;
int tickcnt;
.eb
.sh DESCRIPTION
.db
If a read or write request is made for a part of a file that is locked out by
another user,
.bo
RBF
normally sleeps indefinitely until the conflict is removed.
.bo
SS_TIKS
may be used to cause an error (E$Lock) to be returned to the process
if the conflict still exists after a specific number of clock ticks have
elapsed.
.sp
The argument
.ul
tickcnt
specifies the number of ticks to wait if the record-lock
conflict occurs with the file open on
.ul
path.
A tick count of zero (the default on
.bo
RBF
devices), causes a sleep until the record is released. A tick count of
one means if the record is not released immediately, an error is to be
returned.
.sp
If an error occurs,
.bo
_SS_TIKS
returns the value -1 and the error code is
placed in the global variable
.ul
errno.
.ed
.sh NOTE
.db
This feature exists only on
.bo
RBF
devices.
