.sh NAME
.bb
_gs_gfd - get file descriptor
.eb
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bb
#include <direct.h>
.sp
int _gs_gfd(path, buffer, count)
int path;
struct fildes *buffer;
int count;
.eb
.sh DESCRIPTION
.db
This function will place a copy of the
.bo
RBF
file descriptor sector of the file
opened on PATH into the buffer pointed to by
.ul
buffer.
A maximum of
.ul
count
bytes are copied. The structure
.bo
FILDES,
declared in
.bo
DIRECT.H,
provides a convenient method to access the file descriptor information.
.PP
If and error occurs, this function returns -1 as its value and the error code
is placed in the global variable
.ul
errno.
.ed
.sh NOTE
.db
Be sure the buffer is large enough to hold all the options, or at least
.ul
count
bytes. This call is effective only on
.bo
RBF
devices. Declaring the buffer
as type "struct fildes" is perfectly safe as this structure is predefined to
be large enough to hold all the file descriptor information.
