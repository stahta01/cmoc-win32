.sh DESCRIPTION
.db
These routines are useful for dealing with errors and interrupts
encountered in a low-level subroutine of a program.
.PP
.ul
Goto
in C has a scope only in the function in which it is used; i.e., the label
which is the object of the
.ul
goto
may only be in the same function.  Control can only be transferred elsewhere
by means of the function call, which, fo course, returns to the caller.
In certain abnormal situations a programmer would perfer to be able to start
some section of code again, but this would mean returning up a ladder of
function calls with error indications all the way.
.PP
.bo
SETJMP
is used to "mark" a point in the program where a subsequent
.bo
LONGJMP
can reach.  It places in the buffer, defined in the header file
.bo
SETJMP.H,
enough information for the
.bo
LONGJMP
to restore the environment to that existing at the time
.bo
SETJMP
is called.
.PP
The
.bo
SETJMP 
subroutine
saves its stack environment in
.ul
env
for later use by
.bo
LONGJMP.
It returns value 0.
.PP
The
.bo
LONGJMP
subroutine
restores the environment saved by the last call of
.bo
SETJMP .
It then returns in such a way that execution
continues as if the call of
.bo
SETJMP
had just returned the value
.ul
val
to the function that invoked
.bo
SETJMP,
which must not itself have returned in the interim.
However, 
.bo
LONGJMP
cannot cause 
.bo
SETJMP
to return the value 0. If 
.bo
LONGJMP
is invoked with a 
.ul
val
of 0, 
.bo
SETJMP
will return 1.
All accessible data have values as of the time
.bo
LONGJMP
was called.
.ed
.sh CAVEATS
.db
The
.bo
SETJMP
subroutine does not save current notion of whether the process is
executing as a result of a signal.  The result is that a
LONGJMP to some place as a result of a signal leaves the
signal state incorrect.
.sp
In addition, the variable
.ul
env
MUST be globally declared.
.ed
.sh DIAGNOSTICS
.db
.bo
SETJMP
returns a zero (0) if the call is the the first made in the current
program run.  If a one (1) is returned, then it must be a
.bo
LONGJMP
returning from some deeper level in the program.
