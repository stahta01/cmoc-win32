.sh DESCRIPTION
.db
The
.bo
FERROR
function returns nonzero when an error has
occurred reading or writing the file associated with the file pointer
.ul
fp
has reached its end, otherwise zero is returned.  Unless cleared by
.bo
CLEARERR,
the error indication lasts until the file pointed to by
.ul
fp
is closed, thus preventing any further access to that file.
.PP
The
.bo
FEOF
function returns nonzero when end of file is read on the named input
.ul
fp,
otherwise zero.
.PP
The
.bo
CLEARERR
function resets both the error and
.ul
EOF
indicators on the named file associated with
.ul
fp.
Note that the file is not "fixed" nor does it prevent the error from
occurring again.  It just allows Standard Library functions to at least
try to access the file.
.PP
The
.bo
FILENO
function returns the integer path descriptor
associated with the file pointer
.ul
fp,
for use with Standard Library calls the use path numbers, such as
.ul
close(), open(),
etc.
.ed
.sh CAVEATS
.db
These functions
are implemented as macros in
.bo
STDIO.H
so they
cannot be redeclared.
