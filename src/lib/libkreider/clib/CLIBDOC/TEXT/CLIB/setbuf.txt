setbuf - fix file buffer
.eb
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bb
#include <stdio.h>
.sp
setbuf (fp, buffer)
FILE *fp;
char buffer;
.eb
.sh DESCRIPTION
.db
When the first character is written to or read from a file after it has been
opened by
.bo
FOPEN(),
a buffer is obtained from the system, if required, and assigned to the file
pointer
.ul
fp.
.bo
SETBUF
may be used to forestall this automatic buffer assignment by assigning a user
buffer to the file.
.sp
.bo
SETBUF
must be used after the file has been opened and before any I/O has taken place.
.sp
The buffer must be of sufficient size and a value for a manifest constant,
.bo
BUFSIZ,
is defined in the header file for use in declaration.
.sp
If the
.ul
buffer
argument is
.ul
NULL
(0), the file stream becomes unbuffered and characters are read or written
singly.
.sp
NOTE that the standard error output defaults to unbuffered while the standard
output default to buffered output.
