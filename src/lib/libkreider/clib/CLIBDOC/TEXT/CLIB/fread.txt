.sh NAME
.bb
fread, fwrite - read/write binary data
.eb
.sh SYNOPSIS
.bb
fread(ptr, sizeof(item), nitems, fp)
FILE *fp;
.sp
fwrite(ptr, sizeof(item), nitems, fp)
FILE *fp;
.eb
.sh DESCRIPTION
.db
The
.bo
fread
function reads into a buffer beginning at
.ul
ptr, nitems
of data of the type
.ul
item
from the input file pointer
.ul
fp.
It returns the number of items actually read.
.PP
The
.bo
fwrite
function writes, at most,
.ul
nitems
of data of the type
.ul
item
beginning at
.ul
ptr
to the named output file
.ul
fp.
It returns the number of items actually written.
.PP
In both cases, the type
.ul
item
refers to either a char, int, or unsigned data type.  Care must be taken to
insure the correct values are used.  If, for example, 10 bytes of type
.ul
char
are to be written, then this is the same amount of data going to the output
stream as 5 bytes of type
.ul
int.
.ed
.sh DIAGNOSTICS
.db
Both functions return a
.ul
null
at end of file or if an error occurs.  To insure the correct data is read
or written, the returned number of type
.ul
item
should be compared to what was intended.  If there is a difference, an error
has occured.
