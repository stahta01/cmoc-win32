   The FREE-C runtime library is an ANSI standard C runtime library for the
Windows NT and '95 operating systems.


   The FREE-C runtime library implements all of the standard C library
functions without the use of any IBM or Microsoft proprietary code. Most of
the functions are written in C or assembler where necessary. The source code
for all functions is available.


   The FREE-C runtime library allows the compiler developer to distribute the
library functions in object form without the need for an IBM or Microsoft
license agreement. This frees the developer to write runtime code in C with
the intent of linking the runtime code with the output of a language translator
or to implement the runtime system as a .DLL without the need for any
proprietary third party code.


  In order to use the FREE-C runtime library, the program MUST be compiled
with the following C compiler and Assembler:


   Microsoft Visual C/C++ version 2.0 or greater
   Microsoft MASM Version 6.00 or greater

  The program must then be linked with one of the following libraries:

   CLIBW32.LIB    - Static .LIB
   CLIBW32D.LIB   - Import library for CLIBW32D.DLL

   Steps required:

   1. Create a subdirectory under the root called C

   2. Get the .ZIP file from my site via FTP and place it in this
      directory (call it &quot;c.zip&quot;).

   3. Unzip it by entering pkunzip -d c.zip

   4. Make sure that your environment is set up to run the Microsoft C/C++
      Compiler and Microsoft MASM 6.00 or greater, If you don't know how
      to do this, don't bother going any further, this is NOT for you !

   5. Go into the make directory and run mwin32.bat for to create the
      static .LIB, or mwin32d.bat to create the .DLL version

   6. This should create the .LIB and or .DLL in the .LIB subdirectory.

   7  Go into the SAMPLES directory and type in cwin32 test. This will
      compile and link a stupid test program. make sure that it runs. If
      it does, you have sucessfully created the runtime library.
