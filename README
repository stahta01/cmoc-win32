CMOC for Windows
================

This is a port of CMOC to Windows. The port was pretty easy todo, but CMOC 
does not support linking.

So, I wrote a couple of front ends called lwasm2 & cmoc2, which process
CMOC's output code.

The result is a fully linkable C compiler for 6809 processors. I currently 
support the Coco and Dragon machines, but I will be adding/re-adding the 
Vectrex/OS9 platforms in the comming weeks. The Vectrex/OS9 code is still 
avaliable but im unsure what I have broken.

You need to place the LWTOOL's Win32 binaries into the bin folder. Namely
lwasm.exem, lwlink.exe and lwar.exe.

For easy startup, I have created a Win32 installer which includes everything
except the source code.

There is also a simple CMOC editor (cmocide) which intergrates with cmoc2.exe. 
Cmocide also provides source formatting via astyle, and emulation via xroar (not included).

Xroar must be downloaded and installed with Coco/Dragon ROM's which, well, you
can find for yourself. You must add the path to xroar.exe to your environments
search path in order for cmocide to find it.

To obtain the original source code and more information about CMOC, please
