CMOC Compiler/Editor for Windows
================================

Website:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/cmoc-win32/

This is a port of CMOC to Windows. The port was pretty easy todo, but CMOC 
does not support linking.

So, I wrote a couple of front ends called lwasm2 & cmoc2, which process
CMOC's output code.

The result is a fully linkable C compiler for 6809 processors. I currently 
support the CoCo and Dragon machines, but I will be adding/re-adding the 
Vectrex/OS9 platforms in the comming weeks. The Vectrex/OS9 code is still 
avaliable but im unsure what I may have broken.

You need to place the LWTOOL's Win32 binaries into the bin folder. Namely
lwasm.exem, lwlink.exe and lwar.exe.

For easy startup, I have created a Win32 installer which includes everything
except the source code.

There is also a simple CMOC editor (cmocide) which intergrates with cmoc2.exe. 
Cmocide also provides source formatting via astyle, and emulation via xroar.

To obtain the original source code and more information about CMOC, please
visit the CMOC homepage.

Al's FREE C Runtime Library (A. Maromaty, 21-Apr-1998)
======================================================

The LibC code for WinCMOC would not have been so easy to create
without the work from Al's C runtime library. Im unsure where Al
is at the moment... but you can grab a copy of the original here:
